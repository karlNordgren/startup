Elevator Pitch:

Why is it that the most unhealthy things taste the best? Maybe that doesn’t have to be the case. That's why we created Ambrosia. Now you can find food that is rated to be 1. Healthy 2. Tasty  3. Cost-Efficient and 4. Environmentally sustainable. For those who enjoy eating out or in, there are ratings for both. Not only will you find the best food, on so many levels, but you can order it at the touch of a button.  

Let’s help the world eat food fit for the Gods, but made for man, all while being good for the planet and the pocketbook.
You don't have to climb Mt. Olympus, just go to the Ambrosia app, or Ambrosia.com. 


Key Features:
Food recommendatoins.
